# road_traffic_monitoring
This project implements a real-time vehicle detection and counting system using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking). It can detect and track multiple types of vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, motorbikes, etc.) in video footage and count how many vehicles are entering and leaving a defined region of interest (ROI).
